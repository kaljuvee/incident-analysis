During an unannounced inspection on November 5th, it was observed that multiple workers were operating heavy machinery without the required safety gear such as hard hats and safety shoes. This safety violation not only puts workers at significant risk of sustaining serious or fatal injuries but also exposes the facility to potential regulatory fines and legal repercussions.
