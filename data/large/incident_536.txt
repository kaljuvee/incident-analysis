During the afternoon shift on June 2, an employee at the manufacturing plant tripped over loose wiring near the assembly line and sustained an injury to his right arm. This incident could potentially result in a temporary decrease in production output, and if safety protocols are not reinforced, it may also increase the risk of further injuries.
