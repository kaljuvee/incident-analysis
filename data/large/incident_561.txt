On November 20th, during the second shift, a forklift driver nearly collided with an employee on foot when both didn't observe standard right of way protocols in the manufacturing plant. Had the incident resulted in a collision, it could have led to severe injury of personnel involved and potential halting of operations for hazard assessment and investigation.
