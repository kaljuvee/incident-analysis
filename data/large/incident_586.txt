During routine operations on the assembly line at the Smithson Manufacturing Plant, a mechanical failure in a loading robot almost resulted in a large piece of machinery falling on an employee below. Had the incident occurred, it could have led to severe injuries or potential fatality, and considerable damage to production goods, thus posing a significant impact on employee safety and production capacity.
