Incident: On March 14th, a factory worker was observed operating heavy machinery without the required safety equipment, specifically a helmet and safety gloves. The consequence of this safety violation not only exposes the worker to a high risk of injuries and potential fatalities, but also places the plant at risk for regulatory non-compliance fines and increased liability insurance premiums.
