During the second shift on February 10, an employee nearly sustained a serious injury when an unsecured 25kg material box almost fell from an elevated storage rack in the assembly area. Had the box fallen, the incident could have resulted in significant physical harm to the employee, potential equipment damage, and possible disruption of production timelines.
