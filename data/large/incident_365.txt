During yesterday's evening shift at the manufacturing plant, a worker was observed operating heavy machinery without wearing the necessary safety equipment such as a hard hat and protective gloves. If this behavior continues, it could potentially lead to severe injuries or fatalities and may also result in legal implications for the plant due to non-compliance with safety regulations.
