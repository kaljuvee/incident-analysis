During yesterday's evening shift at the manufacturing plant, an unsecured piece of heavy machinery nearly fell onto a worker in the assembly line area. Had the worker not moved in time, this could have resulted in severe injuries or even a fatal accident, disrupting production and potentially leading to substantial legal and financial repercussions for the company.
