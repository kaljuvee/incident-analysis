On November 4th, a near miss incident occurred at the manufacturing plant, where an unmanned forklift almost collided with an employee due to a failed sensor. Had the employee not noticed the forklift, it could have resulted in severe injuries, potential fatalities, and a temporary shutdown of operations.
