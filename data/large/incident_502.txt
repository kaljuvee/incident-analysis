On April 12th, an employee was severely injured at our manufacturing plant during routine maintenance when their hand got caught in the conveyor belt system. This incident not only resulted in a worker's compensation claim, but also halted production for thorough safety checks, potentially impacting the plant's overall productivity and delivery schedules.
