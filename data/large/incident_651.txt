During the afternoon shift on March 5th, a forklift operator almost collided with a pedestrian employee in the main assembly area due to failed brake system. If it had not been for the quick thinking and evasive actions of both parties involved, this could have resulted in severe injuries or fatalities, potentially halting plant operations.
