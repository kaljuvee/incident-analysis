During yesterday's afternoon shift, a stack of heavy beams in the storage area was found to be unintentionally destabilized, creating a risk of toppling over onto the nearby work path. Had the stack collapsed, it could have resulted in severe injuries or even fatalities among staff members, as well as substantial damage to equipment and operational disruption.
